Standard Linear Regression:
Assumes constant variance

Poisson Regression:
Assumes the mean & variance of event arrivals are reasonably close

Quasi-Poisson Regression:
Asume variance is a linear function of the mean


Calculate the mean and variance of the target variable
```{r}
(mean_df <- mean(df$target))
(var_df <- var(df$target))
```

Fit model and glance the results
```{r}
model <- glm(target ~ ., data = df, family = quasipoisson)
perf <- glance(model)

# Calculate pseudo-R-squared
pseudoR2 <- 1 - perf$deviance/perf$null.deviance
```
